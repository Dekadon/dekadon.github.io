	<h1>Welcome to The Internet</h1>
	<h2><p>Today on 10/10/2016, I figured out how to make a webpage.</h2>
	My name is Kevin and I just want everyone to know that this is my
	website. Not yours, but mine. Now that that is out of the way, I
	would like to take some time to tell you that you should press alt
	f4 before continuing.</p>
	My favorite activites include wallowing in self pity, eating icecream
	while watching youtube cat videos, and crying about my gpa.
